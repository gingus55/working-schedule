Calendar application to save events for each hour of a day

<h1>Description:-</h1>
A day schedule which allows you to store events you have between 9-5 of a working day. The time blocks change colour according to wether the event is in the past, present or future. Buttons allow you to save content or erase the content of a block. Saved data continues through a page reload. There is a clock at the top of the page giving you the current time.
